    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p ><font size="4" face="verdana">Hello, I'm Gangi ShivaKumar. I'm really into technology and software engineering. I'm excited to share my projects and learn from others who are passionate about the same things! Let's talk about music, movies, and cooking too. Music is something I love getting lost in it just takes me to a different place. Movies are great for that too, they make me feel all sorts of emotions. Cooking is a hobby of mine; I like making tasty dishes with simple ingredients.Pawan Kalyan's dynamic presence in both the entertainment industry and politics inspires me with his resilience, leadership, and dedication to serving the community. His ability to fearlessly voice his convictions and stand up for what he believes in encourages me to be bold and principled in my own pursuits. But above all, spending time with my family is what makes me happiest."</font></p><br>
