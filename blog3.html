    <h2>1.Voice Assistant</h2>
    <p><font size="3" face="verdana"> An Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based voice assistant is a popular technology that allows users to interact with a
        computer system using natural language. This technology has gained significant attention in recent years due to
        the increasing demand for smart home automation and personal digital assistants. The use of AI in voice
        assistants has made it possible to create highly intuitive and personalized systems that can recognize and respond
        to user commands in a natural and conversational manner. In this paper, we propose a new AI-based voice
        assistant that utilizes a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to
        understand user intent and provide personalized responses. The system uses a deep neural network (DNN) to
        perform speech recognition, which is then processed using an NLP algorithm to extract the user's intent. The
        system then uses a machine learning model to provide personalized responses based on the user's history and
        preferences. We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of our system, and the results show that our
        AI-based voice assistant achieves high accuracy in recognizing user intent and provide personalized responses.
        With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, voice assistants have become an increasingly popular
        technology in recent years. information, and controlling smart home devices.</font></p>
