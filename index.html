        <p class="center-align"><font size="4" face="verdana">Hello, I'm Gangi ShivaKumar. I'm really into technology and software engineering. I'm excited to share my projects and learn from others who are passionate about the same things! Let's talk about music, movies, and cooking too. Music is something I love getting lost in it just takes me to a different place. Movies are great for that too, they make me feel all sorts of emotions. Cooking is a hobby of mine; I like making tasty dishes with simple ingredients. But above all, spending time with my family is what makes me happiest. We have so much fun together, laughing and making memories."</font></p><br><br>
